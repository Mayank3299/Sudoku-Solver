<pre lang="markdown"> # 🧩 Sudoku Solver (Ruby – Backtracking) This project solves any standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a **backtracking algorithm**, and optionally displays the solving process visually in the terminal (or however you set it up). --- ## 🚀 How to Run Make sure you have Ruby installed. Then simply run: ```bash ruby sudoku_solver.rb ``` --- ## 🗂️ Input Format Your Sudoku puzzle should be saved in a `.txt` file, where: - Each line contains exactly 9 digits - Use `0` to represent empty cells Example (`sudoku3.txt`): ```text 800590700 000000008 030000020 000000000 100007430 000040075 008970002 604051000 900002080 ``` You can modify this file or create your own. Make sure your Ruby code reads from the correct path (`sudoku3.txt` or whichever file you use). --- Let me know if you want to add: - GIF/video preview of the solving animation - CLI arguments for dynamic file input - Or a live demo link if you ever host it Happy puzzling! 😄 </pre>
