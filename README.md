# Sudoku-Solver
🧩 Sudoku Solver (Backtracking – Ruby)

This project solves any standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm, and prints each step visually for fun debugging!

🛠️ How to Run

```bash 
ruby sudoku_solver.rb
```

Make sure you have Ruby installed (2.5+ should be fine).

📄 Input Format
Your Sudoku puzzle should be in a .txt file — each line should contain exactly 9 digits (use 0 for empty cells).

Here’s an example (sudoku3.txt):

```text
800590700 
000000008 
030000020 
000000000 
100007430 
000040075 
008970002 
604051000 
900002080 
```

You can change the file or add your own puzzle file and update the path in the code accordingly.
